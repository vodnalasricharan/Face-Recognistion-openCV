# Face-Recognistion-openCV
## This project is done for Fun,to recognize the faces of me and my friends
### I have done this in two ways
       1)Using vgg16() as recognizer(which didn't give satisfying results)
       2)Using opencv face LBPHFaceRecognizer
## Using vgg16()
        used fies are:
              load_data.py
              model.py
              faces_train.py
              predict.py(for image prediction)
              face_image.py(also for image prediction...just checked if anything other works well)
              video-predict.py(for live video prediction)
I can't provide all the dataset to you as it is custom dataset made by me.ðŸ˜Š
<br>Run the codes in the same order as providedâœŒ
<br>To load data using load_data.py the data should be put in a data folder and images in their respective folders of their label name
